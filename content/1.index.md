I am an Information Technology student currently undertaking a group project on Smart Shoes as part of the Critical & Creative Thinking for Information Technology Solution subject. 
This project focuses on designing a smart device by applying structured thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. 

Throughout the development process, my team and I progressed from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity designs, and finally to a functional shoe prototype. T
he journey provided valuable hands-on experience in transforming ideas into tangible solutions. It also allowed me to reflect deeply on design decisions, teamwork, 
and iterative improvement, strengthening both my technical understanding and critical thinking skills.
