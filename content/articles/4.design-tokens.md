### **Reflecting on Learning**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am learning how to apply critical and creative thinking to develop user-centered IT solutions through the Smart Shoes project in the ICT500 subject. I am learning this to ensure that technological solutions are practical, innovative, and based on real user needs rather than assumptions. Through this project, I learned that creating a smart device is not only about technology, but also about understanding users’ pain points, analysing problems using structured thinking tools, and translating insights into meaningful design decisions.
</p>

### **Reflecting on Project Goals**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I knew I was making progress when our group successfully completed each assignment component, including the empathy map, fishbone diagram, QADIM analysis, and UI design, and when feedback showed strong alignment between our problem statement and solution. Clear task division, regular group discussions, guidance from the course framework, and structured tools like empathy maps and QADIM helped me stay focused and reach my goals. However, challenges such as managing time and coordinating group commitments occasionally slowed progress.
</p>
### **Reflecting on Group Dynamics**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
My peers helped me reach my goals by sharing responsibilities, contributing ideas, and offering different perspectives that strengthened our brainstorming and analysis. When I felt stuck, they encouraged me through weekly Zoom discussions by clarifying concepts, sharing examples, and motivating me to continue working collaboratively rather than individually.
</p>
### **Reflecting on Critical and Creative Thinking**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This project showed that I am good at analysing problems, organising ideas, and linking user needs to practical IT solutions, but I also realised my limitations in overthinking ideas and lacking confidence when presenting them. Interviewing the runner challenged my assumptions and made me think more from the user’s perspective, and I learned from mistakes by reviewing feedback, revising our work, and improving clarity and validation.
</p>
### **What I really Like About This Project**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I enjoyed this project because it let me apply critical and creative problem-solving using real user data. Tools like empathy mapping, fishbone analysis, and QADIM helped me organise ideas clearly while connecting theory to real-life application
</p>
### **Some Things That I Really Need to Work On NOW**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I need to improve my confidence in expressing ideas during group discussions and manage my time better when balancing group work with other commitments, so I can contribute more effectively to future projects.
</p>
### **Some Things That I Could Do to Improve Myself in the Future**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the future, I can improve by practicing design thinking in other projects, participating more in discussions and presentations, and learning basic UI/UX and prototyping tools to express ideas more clearly.
</p>
### **One Thing That I Will Remember Forever About This Project**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I will always remember how interviewing the runner challenged our assumptions and led to better design decisions, teaching me that effective IT solutions start with understanding people, not just technology.
