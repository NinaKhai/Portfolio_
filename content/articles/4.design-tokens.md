# Self Reflection

From the subject ICT500: Critical and Creative Thinking for Information Technology Solution, I gained valuable opportunities for self-reflection through a group project on Smart Shoes. This project helped me apply critical and creative thinking techniques not only in my studies but also in real-life problem solving. I learned to analyse user needs using empathy mapping, identify root causes through the Fishbone Diagram, and structure problem-solving using the QADIM technique, which helped translate ideas into a simple and practical user interface design. These tools trained me to understand real user problems before proposing technology-based solutions, rather than relying on assumptions.

Through the Smart Shoes project, I realised that developing a smart device is not only about technology, but also about deeply understanding users’ pain points, behaviours, and expectations. Interviewing a runner challenged our assumptions and guided us to design more relevant and realistic features. Structured thinking tools made complex problems easier to manage, and I knew I was making progress when our group successfully completed each component, including empathy mapping, fishbone analysis, QADIM, and UI design. Alignment between our problem statement and solution, along with feedback from discussions, showed that we were moving in the right direction.

This project also strengthened my teamwork and self-management skills. Clear task division, regular group discussions, and weekly Zoom meetings helped us stay focused and motivated. My peers contributed diverse ideas and perspectives that expanded my thinking, especially during brainstorming and analysis stages. Their encouragement helped me overcome moments of uncertainty, and I discovered that I am strong in analysing problems, organising ideas, and linking user needs to practical IT solutions. However, I also recognised my limitations, such as overthinking ideas, lacking confidence when presenting creative concepts, and needing more practice in visual and verbal communication.

Overall, this project gave me a complete experience of the critical and creative problem-solving process—from identifying user problems to proposing technology-based solutions grounded in real data. Mistakes such as unclear problem definitions taught me the importance of clarity, validation, and revision. What I valued most was learning that good IT solutions start with understanding people, not just technology. Moving forward, I aim to improve my confidence, time management, communication skills, and knowledge of UI/UX design by applying design thinking in future projects and actively participating in discussions and presentations.
